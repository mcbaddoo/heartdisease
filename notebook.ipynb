Predicted probabilities from our model\n<p>So far, we have built a logistic regression model and examined the model coefficients/ORs. We may wonder how can we use this model we developed to predict a person's likelihood of having heart disease given his/her age, sex, and maximum heart rate. Furthermore, we'd like to translate the predicted probability into a decision rule for clinical use by defining a cutoff value on the probability scale. In practice, when an individual comes in for a health check-up, the doctor would like to know the predicted probability of heart disease, for specific values of the predictors: a 45-year-old female with a max heart rate of 150. To do that, we create a data frame called newdata, in which we include the desired values for our prediction.</p>"},{"metadata":{"tags":["sample_code"],"trusted":false,"collapsed":true,"dc":{"key":"59"}},"outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","execution_count":0,"source":"# Get predicted probability in dataset using the predict() function\n# We include the argument type=”response” in order to get our prediction.\npred_prob <- predict(model, hd_data, type=\"response\")\n\n# Create a decision rule using probability 0.5 as cutoff and save the predicted decision into the main data frame\nhd_data$pred_hd <- ifelse(pred_prob >= 0.5, 1, 0)\n\n# Create a newdata data frame to save a new case information\nnewdata <- data.frame(age=45, sex=\"Female\", thalach=150)\n\n# Predict probability for this new case and print out the predicted value\np_new <- predict(model, newdata, type=\"response\")\np_new"},{"metadata":{"editable":false,"deletable":false,"tags":["context"],"run_control":{"frozen":true},"dc":{"key":"66"}},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 10. Model performance metrics\n<p>Are the predictions accurate? How well does the model fit our data? We are going to use some common metrics to evaluate the model performance. The most straightforward one is Accuracy, which is the proportion of the total number of predictions that were correct. On the other hand, we can calculate the classification error rate using 1- accuracy. However, accuracy can be misleading when the response is rare (i.e., imbalanced response). Another popular metric, Area Under the ROC curve (AUC), has the advantage that it's independent of the change in the proportion of responders. AUC ranges from 0 to 1. The closer it gets to 1 the better the model performance. Lastly, a confusion matrix is an N X N matrix, where N is the level of outcome. For the problem at hand, we have N=2, and hence we get a 2 X 2 matrix. It cross-tabulates the predicted outcome levels against the true outcome levels.</p>\n<p>After these metrics are calculated, we'll see (from the logistic regression OR table) that older age, being male and having a lower max heart rate are all risk factors for heart disease. We can also apply our model to predict the probability of having heart disease. For a 45 years old female who has a max heart rate of 150, our model generated a heart disease probability of 0.177 indicating low risk of heart disease. Although our model has an overall accuracy of 0.71, there are cases that were misclassified as shown in the confusion matrix. One way to improve our current model is to include other relevant predictors from the dataset into our model, but that's a task for another day!</p>"},{"metadata":{"tags":["sample_code"],"trusted":false,"collapsed":true,"dc":{"key":"66"}},"outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","execution_count":0,"source":"# load Metrics package\nlibrary(Metrics)\n\n# calculate auc, accuracy, clasification error\nauc <- ....\naccuracy <- ....\nclassification_error <- ....\n\n# print out the metrics on to screen\nprint(paste(\"AUC=\", auc))\nprint(paste(\"Accuracy=\", accuracy))\nprint(paste(\"Classification Error=\", classification_error))\n\n# confusion matrix\ntable(....,...., dnn=c(....,....)) # confusion matrix"}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
